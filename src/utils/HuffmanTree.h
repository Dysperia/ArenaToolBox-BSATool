/**
 * @brief the adaptive Huffman tree is contained inside an array using the following initial pattern as example :
 *            6
 *          /   \
 *         4     5
 *        / \   / \
 *       0   1 2   3
 * In this example, the numbers are the index in the array. thus, mTree[4] = 0 and you can get children index from
 * mTree[4] and mTree[4]+1. As an other example, mTree[6] = 4.
 * mTree contains all node from left to right one level after an other,
 * going up in the tree. As a result, the first nodes found are the leafs (314 exactly). One can know if there is a
 * right child by looking the value of the left child : if it is a leaf then there is no right child.
 *
 * Since there is no child for a leaf, the value is instead either a color index in a 256 color table or a length to copy (the first 256 are
 * colors and after lengths from 0 to 57 (actual lengths build from these values are in fact value+3 so lengths are in range
 * 3 - 60 in the compression algorithm).
 *
 * In order to isolate leaf values from node index, the leaf values are stored by adding 627. Since it is higher than
 * the maximum index in the tree, it cannot be misunderstood with an index and this test is used to know if a leaf is
 * found.
 *
 * To sum up : color index are leaf value minus 627 and length are leaf value minus 627 minus 256 plus 3.
 *
 * Since this is a adaptive Huffman tree, the frequency of seen values are kept and updated as the algorithm is running and the
 * tree is sorted to keep left frequency lower than right child's one.
 * A father frequency is the sum of the children's frequencies.
